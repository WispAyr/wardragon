# Wardragon Heartbeat Node.js Application

This Node.js application serves as a heartbeat mechanism for Wardragon units, leveraging the MQTT protocol to continuously monitor and report the status of each unit. It is designed specifically for Linux-based systems running DragonOS, using the unique system UUID to ensure each heartbeat message is uniquely identifiable to its corresponding unit. This allows for real-time monitoring and management of Wardragon units across a network, with a focus on security and reliability in Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-centric applications.

## Key Features

- **Unique Identification:** Utilizes the system's UUID on DragonOS environments for precise unit identification.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Sends a status message every second to an MQTT server, indicating the unit's active presence and current timestamp.
- **Real-time Management:** Facilitates efficient monitoring and management of Wardragon units, emphasizing operational integrity.
- **SDR-Centric Design:** Tailored for applications involving Software-Defined Radio, ensuring reliability and security.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed before proceeding.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WispAyr/wardragon/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This simple yet effective approach is designed for seamless integration and ease of use, standing as a cornerstone for maintaining the operational integrity of Wardragon deployments.
